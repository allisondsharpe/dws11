        <h4>Impact of Gaming</h4>
        <p>A <strong>video game</strong> is an electronic game that involves human interaction 
        with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device. The word video 
        in video game traditionally referred to a raster display device, but it now implies 
        any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. The 
        electronic systems used to play video games are known as platforms; examples of 
        these are personal computers and video game consoles. These platforms range from 
        large mainframe computers to small handheld devices. Specialized video games such 
        as arcade games, while previously common, have gradually declined in use. Video games 
        have gone on to become an art form and industry. </p>
        
		<p> The input device primarily used to manipulate video games is called a game controller, 
		and varies across platforms. For example, a controller might consist of only a button and 
		a joystick, while another may feature a dozen buttons and one or more joysticks. 
		Early personal computer games often needed a keyboard for gameplay, or more commonly, 
		required the user to buy a separate joystick with at least one button. Many modern computer 
		games allow or require the player to use a keyboard and a mouse simultaneously. In 
		recent years, additional methods of input have emerged such as camera-based player 
		observation for video game consoles and touch-sensitive screens on mobile devices. </p>
