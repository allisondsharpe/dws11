				<h2> Introduction </h2>
				<p> A <span>video game</span> is an electronic game that involves human 
				interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device. 
				The word video in video game traditionally referred to a raster display device, 
				but it now implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional 
				images. The electronic systems used to play video games are known as platforms; 
				examples of these are personal computers and video game consoles. These platforms 
				range from large mainframe computers to small handheld devices. Specialized video 
				games such as arcade games, while previously common, have gradually declined in use. 
				Video games have gone on to become an art form and industry. </p>
	    		<p> The input device primarily used to manipulate video games is called a game 
				controller, and varies across platforms. For example, a controller might consist 
				of only a button and a joystick, while another may feature a dozen buttons and one
				or more joysticks. Early personal computer games often needed a keyboard for gameplay, 
				or more commonly, required the user to buy a separate joystick with at least one 
	    		button. Many modern computer games allow or require the player to use a keyboard 
	    		and a mouse simultaneously. In recent years, additional methods of input have emerged 
	    		such as camera-based player observation for video game consoles and touch-sensitive 
	    		screens on mobile devices. </p>

	    		<h2> History </h2>
				<p> Although the first video games appeared in the 1950s, they were played on 
				massive computers connected to vector displays, not analog televisions. Ralph H. 
				Baer conceived the idea of a home video game in 1951. In the late 1960s while 
				working for Sanders Associates he created a series of video game console designs. 
				One of these designs, which gained the nickname of the <q>Brown Box</q>, featured 
				changeable game modes and was demonstrated to several TV manufactures ultimately
				leading to an agreement between Sanders Associates and Magnavox. </p>
				<p> In the years that followed, the market saw many companies rushing similar 
				consoles to market. After General Instrument released their inexpensive microchips, 
				each containing a complete console on a single chip, many small developers began 
				releasing consoles that looked different externally, but internally were playing 
				exactly the same games. Most of the consoles from this era were dedicated consoles 
				playing only the games that came with the console. These video game consoles were 
				often just called video games, because there was little reason to distinguish the 
				two yet. While a few companies like <strong>Atari</strong>, <strong>Magnavox</strong>, 
				and newcomer <strong>Coleco</strong> pushed the envelope, the market became flooded 
				with simple, similar video games. </p>

				<h2> Genres </h2>
				<p> <span>Video game genres</span> are used to categorize video games based on 
				their gameplay interaction rather than visual or narrative differences. A video game 
				genre is defined by a set of gameplay challenges. They are classified independent of 
				their setting or game-world content, unlike other works of fiction such as films or 
				books. For example, a <em>shooter game</em> is still a shooter game, regardless of 
				whether it takes place in a fantasy world or in outer space. Within game studies 
				there is a lack of consensus in reaching accepted formal definitions for game genres, 
				some being more observed than others. Like any typical taxonomy, a video game genre 
				requires certain constants. Most video games feature obstacles to overcome, so video 
				game genres can be defined where obstacles are completed in substantially similar 
				ways.</p>
				<p> Following is a listing of commonly used video game genres with brief descriptions 
				and examples of each. This list is by no means complete or comprehensive. Chris Crawford 
				noted in 1984 that <q>the state of computer game design is changing quickly. We would 
				therefore expect the taxonomy presented here to become obsolete or inadequate in a 
				short time.</q> As with nearly all varieties of genre classification, the matter of 
				any individual video game's specific genre is open to personal interpretation. Moreover, 
				it is important to be able to think of each individual game as belonging to several 
				genres at once. </p>
